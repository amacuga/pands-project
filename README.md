## Summary of the Iris data set
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis". It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes:
1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. species:
=> Iris Setosa
=> Iris Versicolour
=> Iris Virginica

The Iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine leaning purpose. This dataset is free and is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
